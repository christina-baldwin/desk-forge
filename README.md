# Final Bootcamp Project - DeskForge

The assignment was to create a full-stack React app that solves a clear problem.

I decided to create an app that helps hobbyists, specifically warhammer 40k, to organise their workspaces by uploading a photo of their desk space and getting AI-generated suggestions.
